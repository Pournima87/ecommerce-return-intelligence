# 🛍️ E-commerce Returns & Refund Intelligence Dashboard

This project is a complete analysis of e-commerce return behaviors using synthetic and cleaned datasets. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python with a powerful interactive Power BI dashboard to derive insights into return patterns, refund policies, and product-level risks.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing on raw return data
- Performed exploratory data analysis using Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Identified high-risk return products and patterns
- Built a business-ready Power BI dashboard for stakeholders
- Generated actionable insights to minimize returns and optimize operations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (for interactive dashboards)
- CSV (for raw and processed datasets)
